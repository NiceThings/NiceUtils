## Installation with Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

```
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Drafter into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

`github "mattthousand/MattUtils"`

## Usage

Make sure you import the MattUtils Module. `import MattUtils`
